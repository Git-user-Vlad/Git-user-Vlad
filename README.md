- 👋 Hi, My name is Vlad, I was born on 93 in a small city of romania from EU. Since i Was a young kid i used to take apart things and build new ones from scratch. I feel I have a wonderful mind to explore I just didn't not know what path to take as kid as I didn't have to many options at that time. I Finished Automotive trade school and was awarded a certificate in mechanics and technician that I never got the chance to use.
- 👀 I’m interested in Software development as a career and I have made it my goal to become junior dev by the end of 2023.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, HTML , CSS , Javascript, Bash and navigation commands.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small projects or any job oportunity that might aid me on my career.
- 📫 You can reach me by email or discord.
